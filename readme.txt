== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What page will my storage units be displayed on? =
When you first install the plugin and configure it's settings, StoragePress will create a new page in your WordPress site.  This page will contain a paginated query loop with all you Storage Units listed on the page.  If you wish to customize this page, you can do so using the normal block editor and the extra blocks that StoragePress provides.  Should you wish use a different page as your listing page, simply build out a new page in the block editor, and then select that page in the StoragePress settings under "Unit Listing Page:".

= Does your plugin use email notifications? =
Yes, it does!  StoragePress sends emails when a number of different events occurs.  It sends an email to the business admin email address when a new request to use a storage unit is made, and an email to the person who requested to reserve the storage unit when the business owner decides whether to grant or deny their request.  Contact me if you would like email notifications when other events occur.

== 3rd-Party Libraries ==
This plugin makes use of one third party javascript library, AlpineJS, for reactivity on certain parts of the admin interface.  It is a lightweight library that makes it easy to sprinkle in reactive variables and client-side DOM rendering throughout an application.
